## Project Description
This repository is designed to automate the collection of hotel data from popular travel websites like **MakeMyTrip** , **Kayak** , and **Booking.com**. It scrapes hotel details, including prices, ratings, geographic coordinates, and additional features. This data is useful for building models to assess hotel pricing strategies, customer preferences, and competitive analysis.

## Data Collection Details
The data collection scripts scrape hotel information from the following websites:<br/>

1. MakeMyTrip: Scrapes hotel names, prices, reviews, and ratings.
2. Kayak: Collects hotel pricing, star ratings, and location data.
3. Booking.com: Extracts hotel details including prices, amenities, and user reviews.<br/>
The collected data is saved in a structured format, such as CSV, for further analysis.

###     Pagination Handling
This project utilizes Selenium to handle various pagination styles across different websites. These include:<br/>

- Virtual Scroll: Automatically scrolls to load new content dynamically as the page is scrolled.
- Infinite Scroll: Detects when the user reaches the bottom of the page and scrolls further to load more data.
- Standard Pagination: Handles traditional pagination with numbered pages and "Next" buttons.
- Virtual Scroll with "Load More" Button: Clicks the "Load More" button to load additional data.<br/>
The Selenium scripts are designed to handle these pagination styles efficiently to ensure comprehensive data collection from all pages.
