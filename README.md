Project Description
This repository is designed to automate the collection of hotel data from popular travel websites like MakeMyTrip, Kayak, and Booking.com. It scrapes hotel details, including prices, ratings, geographic coordinates, and additional features. This data is useful for building models to assess hotel pricing strategies, customer preferences, and competitive analysis.

Data Collection Details
The data collection scripts scrape hotel information from the following websites:

MakeMyTrip: Scrapes hotel names, prices, reviews, and ratings.
Kayak: Collects hotel pricing, star ratings, and location data.
Booking.com: Extracts hotel details including prices, amenities, and user reviews.
The collected data is saved in a structured format, such as CSV, for further analysis.

Pagination Handling
This project utilizes Selenium to handle various pagination styles across different websites. These include:

Virtual Scroll: Automatically scrolls to load new content dynamically as the page is scrolled.
Infinite Scroll: Detects when the user reaches the bottom of the page and scrolls further to load more data.
Standard Pagination: Handles traditional pagination with numbered pages and "Next" buttons.
Virtual Scroll with "Load More" Button: Clicks the "Load More" button to load additional data.
The Selenium scripts are designed to handle these pagination styles efficiently to ensure comprehensive data collection from all pages.
